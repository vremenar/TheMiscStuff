# Croatian_Passwords_Sorted_With_Count.txt
List of passwords used by Croatians, sorted by number of usages with a number of occurrences
This list a research project because commonly available passwords lists do not reflect usage of a password outside English language. This passwords are not reverse engineered, hacked, cracked, etc. These passwords are a compilation of plain text dumps easily searchable on public Internet. I just extracted passwords used by Croatians.
This list is provided to be used in other research projects and in systems that can utilize this information to secure their users (e.g. disallow usage of top 50 most used passwords). You can freely use or change this list but do give a proper credit.
